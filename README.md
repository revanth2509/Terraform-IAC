# Terraform-IAC
<p style="color:blue">Terraform-State file and Build Files.</p>

This repository contains Terraform files for deploying infrastructure on `AWS`. The main.tf file defines the resources to be provisioned, including `EC2` instances, `S3` buckets, and `VPCs`. The `variables.tf` file contains the input variables for the Terraform configuration, such as the instance type, subnet IDs, and IAM role names. The output.tf file defines the output values from the Terraform configuration, such as the public IP address of the EC2 instance and the bucket ARN. The provider.tf file specifies the AWS provider and the region to use. 

The backend.tf file configures the remote backend for storing the state file in an S3 bucket. The modules directory contains reusable modules for provisioning specific resources, such as a module for creating an ECS cluster. Finally, the examples directory provides sample Terraform configurations for different use cases, such as creating a simple web application or a multi-tier application.
